  summary: `Hello, I'm Ndung'u Kinyanjui ‚Äî a DevSecOps Engineer and AWS Certified Solutions Architect passionate about building secure, scalable, and cloud-native systems that power modern applications.

I blend software engineering, cloud architecture, and security best practices to streamline infrastructure, automate deployments, and harden systems from code to cloud.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Daystar University, I focus on mentoring peers and leading community-driven learning initiatives in cybersecurity and cloud technologies.

With hands-on experience in full-stack development, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and cloud compliance, I strive to bridge the gap between development speed and operational security.

I believe in continuous learning, purposeful engineering, and using technology to drive innovation that is not only fast ‚Äî but fundamentally secure.`,
